## List of Solana public RPC endpoints | By Everstake & extrnode

extrnode is building an open-source load balancer to allow dApps developers to connect to a cluster of public RPC nodes and automatically reconnect if any node is down. Everstake’s RPC endpoint will be added to the cluster to ensure 99.9% uptime, no matter what.

While our free load balancer work is still underway, we offer a list of Solana public RPC endpoints.

We have gathered a list of 80+ RPC endpoints by scanning the network via publicly available Solana’s JSON-RPC. All of them are live and ready to help the community. We monitor them via the stats page, Grafana, and logs to ensure that this list of nodes is always up-to-date.

Please see Solana public RPC endpoints [here](./rpc_list.csv)
